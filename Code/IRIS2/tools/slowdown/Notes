Discovered that although the SunOS/slash-proc version allows us to specify a
list of system calls we're interested in, when the ioctl returns, it -doesn't-
always return with one of our selected system calls.  So today I added a switch
on the syscalls we're interested, to ignore the one's we don't care about - IE,
to not pause on uninteresting syscalls.

monitor function now takes another argument, which distinguishes between
a process we're attaching to, and a process we're forking ourselves.
The variable is unneeded in the Solaris /proc version, but the Linux
ptrace() version requires it.

Modified code to have one "common.c", and then one OS-specific .c for
each of SunOS and Linux.  The SunOS code uses /proc, and the linux code
uses ptrace().

slowdown.c appears to work on Fedora Core 3, and uses ptrace().  FC3
doesn't appear to have a praddset function, among other missing items
for a /proc implementation.

slowdown2.c appears to work on Solaris 8, and uses /proc.
the ptrace version doesn't work on Solaris 8...

I hope to merge these into a single program at some point in the future.
