IRIS2 network radio project. This repository will contain all the necessary information required to build the unit.

Project images and video clips: https://drive.google.com/open?id=105BILNTAdYNRVomJvfbO0CPW3QA1uIXu

Currently we have here:
 - Code for core Iris application along with all necessary system scripts 
 - KiCad projects/schematics for all PCB's
 - STL's of all parts of the IRIS2 case
 - Some initial documentation
 
What we need to add:
 - More documentation
 - Detailed assembly instructions for all the PCB's and the unit itself
 - Detailed BOM for all of the PCB's, and additional stuff required to assemble the unit itself
 - Detailed instructions on how to make your own copy of IRIS2 firmware based on Raspbian (and/or firmware images)
